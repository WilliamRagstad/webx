## Getting started
### Installation
Download the latest prebuilt binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/WilliamRagstad/WebX/releases) and extract it to a folder of your choice.

### Usage
To start the web server for a project, use:
```sh
webx run
```

To run the project in production mode, use:
```sh
webx run --prod
```

<br>

## Examples
The following is an example of a simple WebX todo list application.
```typescript
model User {
  id: number @primary @autoincrement;
  name: string[maxLength(50))]
  email: string?; // optional
  isAdmin: boolean;
}

model Todo {
  id: number @primary @autoincrement;
  task: string;
  userId: number @foreign(User.id);
}

handler initServices() { 
  userService: new UserService(),
  todoService: new TodoService()
}

handler auth(userService: UserService, id: number) {
  user: userService.getCurrentUser(id)
}

handler isAdmin(user: User) {
  if (!user.isAdmin()) {
    return error("User is not an admin.");
  }
}

handler renderTodos(todos: Todo[], user: User): HTML {
  return (<div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => <li>{todo.task}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>);
}

// Endpoint: GET /todos/<user id>
get /todos/(id: number) -> initServices(), auth($.userService, id), isAdmin($.user) {
    const todos = $.todoService.getAllTodosForUser($.user.id);
    return { todos };
} -> renderTodos($.todos, $.user)
```

## Why Web<font color="#3d72d7">X</font>?
**Our vision** is to reduce the boilerplate and complexity of building backends and APIs.\
‚ñ∏ WebX is designed to be **simple**, **minimal**, **easy to learn**, and **intuitive** while still being **versatile** and **flexible**.
It is capable of building complex applications **quickly** while still being **lightweightü™∂** and **blazingly fastüî•**.

> **Backends shouldn't be bloated and complex**, but focus on what's most important.
> Don't reinvent the wheel for every new project,\
> ‚ñ∏ Jump straight to ***the goodi-goodi parts*** and get [started using](#getting-started) **WebX** today!

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Perfect match for <b><<font color="#3d72d7">/</font>> htm<font color="#3d72d7">x</font></b>
WebX is designed to be a minimalistic web framework that is easy to learn and use.
It is ***intended*** to be used with **HTMX**, which is a great alternative to frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular (or other stacks).
HTMX allows you to build dynamic web applications without having to learn a new language or framework for the frontend.
WebX is designed to be versatile and flexible, and it is easy to build backends for complex applications quickly.
