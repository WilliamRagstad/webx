<br>

## Getting started
### Installation
Download the latest prebuilt binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/WilliamRagstad/WebX/releases) and extract it to a folder of your choice.

### Usage
To start the development web server for a project, use:
```sh
webx run
```
This enable **hot reloading** üî•, **extensive logging**, **safe real-time error reporting**, and other useful features.
<br><br>
To run the project in production mode, use:
```sh
webx run --prod
```
This enable **optimizations** üöÄ (*for speed and memory performance improvements*), **caching**, **compression**, and other useful features. It also *disables hot reloading and logging* to **not leak any sensitive information**.

<br>

## Examples
The following is an example of a simple WebX todo list application.
```typescript
include "../common.webx"

global {
  const db = new Database("sqlite://db.sqlite");
}

model User {
  id: number @primary @autoincrement;
  name: string[maxLength(50))]
  email: string?;
  isAdmin: boolean;
}

model Todo {
  id: number @primary @autoincrement;
  task: string;
  userId: number @foreign(User.id);
}

handler initServices() {
  return {
    userService: new UserService(db),
    todoService: new TodoService(db)
  };
}

handler auth(userService: UserService, id: number) {
  const user = userService.getCurrentUser(id);
  if (!user) error("User not found.");
  return { user };
}

handler isAdmin(user: User) {
  if (!user.isAdmin()) error("User is not an admin.");
}

handler renderTodos(todos: Todo[], user: User): HTML {
  return (<div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => <li>{todo.task}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>);
}

get /todos/(id: number) -> initServices:s, auth(s.userService, id):a, isAdmin(a.user) {
    const todos = s.todoService.getAllTodosForUser(a.user.id);
} -> renderTodos(todos, a.user)
```

## Why <b>Web<font color="#3d72d7">X</font></b>?
**Our vision** is to reduce the boilerplate and complexity of building backends and APIs.\
‚ñ∏ WebX is designed to be **simple**, **minimal**, **easy to learn**, and **intuitive** while still being **versatile** and **flexible**.
It is capable of building complex applications **quickly** while still being **lightweightü™∂** and **blazingly fastüî•**.

> **Backends shouldn't be bloated and complex**, but focus on what's most important.
> Don't reinvent the wheel for every new project,\
> ‚ñ∏ Jump straight to ***the goodi-goodi parts*** and get [started using](#getting-started) **WebX** today!

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Perfect match for <b><<font color="#3d72d7">/</font>> htm<font color="#3d72d7">x</font></b>
WebX is designed to be a minimalistic web framework that is easy to learn and use.
It is ***intended*** to be used with **HTMX**, which is a great alternative to frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular (or other stacks).
HTMX allows you to build dynamic web applications without having to learn a new language or framework for the frontend.
WebX is designed to be versatile and flexible, and it is easy to build backends for complex applications quickly.\

### What about <b><font color="#3d72d7">///_h</font>yper<font color="#3d72d7">s</font>cript</b>?
HyperScript is a front-end JavaScript DSL for creating and manipulating HTML DOM elements. It is lightweight, tightly coupled with your HTML code, and is easy to learn.\
*While JSX is the default JS+HTML DSL* in Webx, HyperScript is supported **natively** by WebX and can also be configured to be used in the project settings.\
